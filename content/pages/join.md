## Bridging urban morphology and community ecology to study structure, organisation and evolution of cities

Cities, composed of a plethora of layers, physical or not, made by humans or nature, are entities that, due to their complexity, tend to be abstracted and oversimplified when being analysed.
However, they can be conceptualised as complex adaptive systems, with many layers being intertwined with the others. When focusing on a layer of urban form - the physical built-up aspects - reflecting the structure of cities and an environment within which all the other components take place, the field of urban morphology tends to simplify the variety into a set of well-known archetypes. This project will move beyond the archetypal conceptualisation of urban form and apply data-driven techniques to explore the ecology of urban form.

In many aspects, ecological communities are similar to cities as both are spatially constrained complex adaptive systems. Where urban morphology struggles to analyse the variety of urban form and opts for archetypes, community ecology offers a theory and a robust set of advanced methods for analysing such systems that can be brought to urban morphology. The core of this project will focus on understanding the ability of community ecology to describe the physical environment of cities and uncover underlying patterns forming the places we live in. The project's scope will be primarily methodological research leading to the development of new techniques, potentially affecting both urban morphology and community ecology, and creating tools to use them.

This project will take the form of an open, data-driven, multidisciplinary research done in cooperation with the Department of Social Geography and Regional Science (Martin Fleischmann) and the Department of Ecology (David Hořák, EcoSpace group). It should bring together quantitative community ecology and spatial data science with links to scientific software development (in Python).
Applicants should have a degree in geography, ecology, urban sciences (urban studies, planning, architecture) or other relevant fields. Inclination towards data science and geoinformatics is expected. Experience with programming languages for data science is a benefit but not a strict requirement.

The salary for the position starts at 1140 EUR per month.

## Inequality of neighbourhood choice in regions of Central Europe

People can be characterised from many aspects, but one can tell more than most of the other - where they live. This project focuses on the interplay between the two aspects of cities - for one, their population and for the other, their built-up form - to understand the housing patterns in the countries of Central Europe and the ability of different socio-economic groups of population to inhabit them. Both location and a type of urban development play a significant role in their lifestyle choices and accessibility to basic services and amenities or dependency on individual transportation when moving around. However, not everyone is equally able to choose where to settle. People always migrated either within cities, or regions and countries, and housing preference played a significant role. Yet, the housing affordability crisis intensifies the pressure and limits the set of choices for many. This project maps how this pressure affects the equality of access to the neighbourhood-level housing types within the regions of Central Europe (limited to Austria, Czechia, Germany, Poland, Slovakia).

Methodologically, the project will use a combination of a computational social science based on the recent national censuses combined with additional open data sources, and morphological analysis of the built environment using methods known as urban morphometrics. The former provides a quantitative insight into society's structure, while the latter quantifies the environment and describes neighbourhood-level housing types from a data-driven built-form typology. This combination allows for quantitative analysis of the relationship between people and places, leading to the assessment of (in)equality of access to the desired place to live and the capability of different groups to make such a choice.

This project will take the form of an open, data-driven research following the techniques of spatial data science with links to scientific software development (in Python).

Applicants should have a degree in geography, demography, social science, urban sciences (urban studies, planning, architecture) or other relevant fields. Inclination towards data science and geoinformatics is expected. Experience with programming languages for data science is a benefit but not a strict requirement.

The salary for the position starts at 1140 EUR per month.
