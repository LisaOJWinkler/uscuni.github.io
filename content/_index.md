The research group on Urban Structure at Charles University (US CUNI) is a small informal research group based in the [Urban and Regional Laboratory](https://urrlab.cz/en/) at the Department of Social Geography and Regional Development at the Faculty of Science in the heart of Prague.

We specialise on <span class="pygment">open spatial data science</span> focusing on <span class="pygment">cities</span>, their internal structure, interactions within and beyond their borders, the composition of their elements, the configuration of their networks, underlying processes guiding their nature, and the evolutionary patterns from the past to the future. Our interests encompass urban morphology, mobility patterns, socio-economic structures, or function of places, extending to the application of earth observation and artificial intelligence in the urban context.
